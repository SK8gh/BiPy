## Introduction

The Binance Python API can be complicated to use, especially due to the odd format of the returned object.

This script implements the following components:

- Binance wrapper: Returns the requested data in a clearer format.
- Tests of the wrapper.
- A Flask application implementing a gateway between a requester and the Binance API.
- Gateway tests.
